<p>The young programmer had an idea, and everyone thought it was nuts. Just out of college, he’d gotten a job writing software for YY, a livestreaming company based in the mas­sive city of Guangzhou, in China’s Pearl River Delta. More than 100 million users every month stream them­selves, or tune in to broadcasts of others, singing, playing video­games, or hosting talk shows from their Beijing apartments. The audience chats back, prolifically, via voice or text. </p>

<p>I’m in a black Mercedes-Benz van with three Samsung Electronics PR people heading toward Yongin, a city about 45 minutes south of Seoul. Yongin is South Korea’s Orlando: a nondescript, fast-growing city known for its tourist attractions, especially Everland Resort, the country’s largest theme park. But the van isn’t going to Everland. We’re headed to a far more profitable theme park: the Samsung Human Resources Development Center, where the theme just happens to be Samsung. </p>

<p>For most North American young people, the word “apprentice” calls to mind either Donald Trump’s reality-TV show, or the plumber’s assistant who helped install a new drain in the basement. But in North Carolina, it increasingly means a ticket to an advanced manufacturing job straight out of high school. The state has won numerous accolades for its Apprenticeship 2000 program, which is designed to prepare people as young as 16 for local factory jobs by following an apprenticeship model first perfected in Germany: four years of free training split between school and the workplace, and a job upon completion. </p>

He came to office leading a vast business enterprise that includes real estate, casinos, and a lucrative branding operation. “The network is huge,” says designer Kim Albrecht, whose riveting data visualization Trump Connections attempts to untangle it all. </p>
